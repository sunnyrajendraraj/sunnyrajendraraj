AI fails when optimized for outputs instead of execution.  
I design systems that survive users, constraints, and reality.

## What I Do

* **AI Product Manager in the making**, focused on **LLM-powered, agentic systems**
* Translate **messy human problems** into **clear product specs & system constraints**
* Bridge **users ↔ models ↔ engineers ↔ business outcomes**
* Obsessed with **execution reliability, observability, and human-in-the-loop AI**

## Current Role

### **AI Product Analyst Intern**

**Kookar AI (Stealth Startup)** · Gurugram
*July 2025 – Present*

> Owned end-to-end product outcomes for a production AI system used by real households.

**Impact Highlights**

* Led transformation of an **AI meal-planning product used by 500+ households**
* Diagnosed a **40% real-world failure rate** despite **85% model accuracy** via **50+ user interviews**
* Redesigned system from **sync → async architecture**, reducing calls **40 → 18 minutes**
* Built **dual-memory system** (Meal Memory + Household State)
  → **90% hallucination reduction**, **60% fewer support tickets**
* Designed **5-stage agentic filtration pipeline** over **3,000+ dishes**, cutting context noise by **70%**
* Converted creative agent → deterministic retrieval
  → Accuracy improved **6.2 → 8.7 / 10**
* Evaluated **1,200+ LLM traces** using LangSmith
  → Reduced manual edits from **60% → <10%**
* Codified **100+ operational rules** into a structured **World Knowledge Base & SOPs**

> I don’t “prompt tweak.” I redesign systems.

## Research Experience

### **Research Intern – Medical AI**

**IIT Mandi** · May 2024 – July 2024

* Built AI-assisted **prostate cancer detection system** on **346 MRI scans**
* Improved diagnostic accuracy **82% → 94%**
* Reduced false positives by **20%**
* Translated insights from **8 physician interviews** into deployable technical specs
* Balanced **95% sensitivity** with **clinical explainability**

> I convert expert intuition into product constraints.

## Flagship Product Case Studies

### **Why AI-Generated Meal Plans Fail in Real Households**

*End-to-End AI Product Research*
*(Mar 2026 – Apr 2026)*

* Studied **500+ Indian households**
* Used **journey mapping, RCA (5 Whys), LLM trace analysis**
* Identified execution-level failures invisible in offline metrics

**Key Insight**

> AI products fail when optimized for output quality instead of execution reliability.

**Product Takeaway**

* Human-in-the-loop
* Constraint-aware orchestration
* Observability > raw accuracy

---

### **AI Product Manager Replica Agent**

*Product Thinking Simulation*

* Designed an AI agent that simulates:

  * Problem framing
  * PRD reasoning
  * Prioritization
  * Metrics & trade-offs
* Conclusion:

> AI accelerates analysis, but PM judgment is irreplaceable in ambiguity.

> I use AI as leverage, not a crutch.
